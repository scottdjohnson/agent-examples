# AI and Agents Learning Examples

This repository contains a series of educational examples demonstrating AI and agent concepts, built as learning exercises.

## ⚠️ Important Warning

**These examples should NOT be used in production environments.** They execute arbitrary Python code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which may pose security risks to the laptop or server they are running on.

Use these examples only for educational purposes and exercise extreme caution.

## Examples

- **`prompt_example/`** - Basic example of sending prompts to Ollama LLM
- **`llm_action/`** - Advanced example that extracts and executes LLM-generated Python code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ollama installed and running locally

## Ollama Setup

### Install Ollama

**macOS:**
```bash
brew install ollama
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
```

**Windows:**
Download from [ollama.ai](https://ollama.ai)

### Start Ollama and Pull Models

```bash
# Start the Ollama service
ollama serve

# In a separate terminal, pull the required models
ollama pull codellama:7b
ollama pull codellama:7b
```

For smaller models, try `llama3.2:1b` or see: https://ollama.com/search

For further questions see: https://ollama.com


## Getting Started

Each example folder contains its own README with setup instructions and usage details.

### Running Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
ollama pull codellama:7b
ollama pull qwen2.5:7b
pytest -v
```

Run a specific test:
```bash
pytest test_prompt_example.py -v
```

Each test:
1. Calls the testable function with sample input
2. Defines expected criteria for valid output
3. Uses `llm_judge()` to evaluate if result meets criteria
4. LLM returns PASS/FAIL with explanation
