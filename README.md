# AI and Agents Learning Examples

This repository contains a series of educational examples demonstrating AI and agent concepts, built as learning exercises.

## ⚠️ Important Warning

**These examples should NOT be used in production environments.** They execute arbitrary Python code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs), which may pose security risks to the laptop or server they are running on.

Use these examples only for educational purposes and exercise extreme caution.

## Examples

- **`prompt_example/`** - Basic example of sending prompts to Ollama LLM
- **`llm_action/`** - Advanced example that extracts and executes LLM-generated Python code

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ollama installed and running locally

## Ollama Setup

brew install ollama
```

**Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.ai/install.sh | sh
