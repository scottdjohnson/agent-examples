# LLM Action App

A Python application that takes user input, sends it to CodeLlama, extracts code from the response, saves it to a file, and executes it.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Ollama installed and running (see top-level README for setup)

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

Run the application:
```bash
python app.py
```

Example prompt: "Give me the current time in San Francisco"

Output: The time in San Francisco, as determined by a newly created and executed Python script


## Safety Note

⚠️ **Warning**: This application executes code generated by an LLM. Only use with trusted prompts and be aware of potential security risks.

## Changing Models

In `app.py`, you can change the model by modifying the `LLM` parameter. For example:
- `'codellama:7b'` (current)
- `'llama2'`
- Any other model you have installed
